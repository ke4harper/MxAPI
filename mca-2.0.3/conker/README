Conker (concurrency kernel) suite of benchmarks:
These tests compare the various types of MCAPI communication against pipes and 
sockets for both forked and pthreaded tests.  There is also a mcapi_demo.pl 
script in the conker/scripts directory that will pop-up a GUI for running the
benchmarks as well as graphs of the results.

You will need the following tools to build MCAPI.  Older versions may work, 
this is a list of what I used:
 gnu-autogen-5.5.7
 gnu-autoconf-2.60
 gnu-libtool-1.5.10
 gnu-m4-1.4
 gnu-make-3.80
 gnu-gcc-4.1.1
 perl-5.8.0
To use the mcapi_demo.pl you will also need the following perl modules:
 Tk
 Tk::Graph
 Tk widgets LabFrame

You will also need the MRAPI library.  Conker will search your path for it or 
you can use the --with-mrapi=<mrapi_dir> option to autogen.  

You will also need the MCAPI library.  Conker will search your path for it or 
you can use the --with-mcapi=<mcapi_dir> option to autogen.  

To build Conker:
 ./autogen.sh --disable-shared 
 make
 make check

We have tested Conker on the following platforms:
  *linux 2.4.21-40 running on a dual-core 64bit AMD opteron
  *WindowsXP on a dell latitude laptop using cygwin (gcc 3.4.4 cygming special)
  *linux 2.6.23 running on a dual-core 32bit Powerpc e500v2 (8572)
  *linux 2.6.9 running on a single-core 64bit AMD opteron


Notes for cross-compilation:
To cross-compile, pass the --build and --host options to autogen, powerpc example:
--build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=powerpc-e500mc-linux-gnu
This will look for executables like: powerpc-e500mc-linux-gnu-gcc so make sure they 
are in your path.

Notes for cygwin:
cygserver provides the sysvr4 support that MRAPI needs for 
semaphores and shared memory.

1) when you install cygwin don't check the "install only for me" 
option because it prevents cygserver from working because it 
can't see all the mounts. 

2) run the following commands to start cygserver
export CYGWIN=server
net start cygserver
