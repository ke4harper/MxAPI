=head1 NAME

 driver:  Regression driver.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The regression driver is a framework for a regression suite.  Refer
to the full man page for more information.

=head1 OPTIONS

Command-line options:

=over 8

=item B<--list, --l>

List the tests in this regression.

=item B<--tests=range, --t=range>

Specify what tests to run.  Should be a number, range, or list of numbers or
ranges, where the numbers refer to indices of the test array (1 is the first
test).  See below fora description of the range format.  Multiple instances of
this parameter may be used.

=item B<--exclude=range, --x=range>

Exclude tests.  Should be a number, range, or list of numbers of ranges.  See
below for a description of the range format.  Multiple instances of this option
may be specified.

=item B<--string=str, --s=str>

Run any tests which contain string I<str>.  This is a simple substring search,
not a regular expression search. Multiple instances of this option may be
specified and are used as a conjunction.

=item B<--regex=re, --r=re>

Run any tests which match regular expression I<re>. Multiple instances of this
option may be specified and are used as a conjunction.

=item B<--keepoutput, --ko>

Do not delete temporary files. 

=item B<--showcmd, --sc>

Print the command to be executed.  This is implied if I<--debug> is set.

=item B<--debug[=level], --d[=level]>

Enable debug messages.  The default (no argument) is to display a minimal amount
of information.  Extra debug levels are available, however.

=item B<--seed>

Specify a seed value.

=back

The valid range forms are:

      x-y:  Run tests x through y.  Example:  --tests=3-5

       -y:  Run tests from start, up to and including y.

       x-:  Run tests x through the last one.

Note:  Multiple parms are allowed and are concatenated together.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Library usage:

use lib "..";
use rdriver;

doTest(@tests_list);

B<doTest>, the main entry function, takes an array reference as a parameter.

=head2 Hash Keys

Each entry in the supplied array should be a hash.  These are the allowed keys:

=over 8

=item B<cmd>

Command-line to execute.  If the token &seed is found, it will be replaced with
a numerical seed.  This value will either be the value specified by the seed
command-line parameter, or the current result of time().

=item B<pre>

Function to execute before running the command.

=item B<nocmts>

Remove comments from diff.  Default is 0 (preserve).  Set this to the comment
character or string that you want to remove, e.g. "#".

=item B<stdio>

Capture standard output.

=item B<stderr>

Direct standard error to standard output for capture.

=item B<diff>

Diff the output with the file specified.

=item B<dpfx>

Only diff the output that starts with the given prefix.  This may be a regular
expression.

=item B<checker>

If present, this should be a function reference.  The function is called with
the test output as its argument and should die if an error occurs.

=item B<fail>

If this is non-zero then the cmd run is expected to have a non-zero return
value. The test will fail if 0 is returned.  The checking commands will still be
executed if they are present.  The value of fail should match the error code
returned by the program, or should be 999 to represent a don't-care condition.

=item B<temps>

Specify temporary files.  These will be unlinked after the test is complete,
unless the --keepoutput option is set on the command-line.

=over

=head2 Utility Functions

The library also contains a number of utility functions.  These are listed
below.

=back 8

=item file_rdiff(<filename>,<array ref of regular expressions | string>)

This is a simple function for checking a file.  The second argument is a
reference to an array of strings.  Each string is considered to be a regular
expression.  The function must be able to successfully match lines in the file
against the array elements, proceeding to the end of the array, or else it fails
and calls die.

The regular expressions can be either a reference to an array of strings/regular
expressions or a single string.  If the latter, we'll split the string on
newlines.  This can be useful when you have a block of data that you want to
check: Rather than quoting each item, simply use here-document syntax.

=item str_rdiff(<input string>,<array ref of regular expressions | string>)

Same as file_rdiff, except that we take the input, split on newlines, then try
and match against the regular expressions.

=item dprint(...)

Same functionality as print if the --debug option is specified on the
command-line.  Otherwise, nothing is printed.

=item dprintf(...)

Same functionality as printf if the --debug option is specified on the
command-line.  Otherwise, nothing is printed.
