This implementation is a prototype implementation of MRAPI.  A spec has not 
yet been published by the Multicore Association.  We implemented the
bare minimum set of functionality needed for our initial (shared memory)
MCAPI implementation.  This includes basic support for two resources
1) semaphores and 2) shared memory.


You will need the following tools to build MRAPI.  Older versions may work, 
this is a list of what I used:
 gnu-autogen-5.5.7
 gnu-autoconf-2.60
 gnu-libtool-1.5.10
 gnu-m4-1.4
 gnu-make-3.80
 gnu-gcc-4.1.1
 perl-5.8.0

This initialial implementation depends on sysvr4 for shared memory and 
semaphore support.

To build MRAPI:
 ./autogen.sh --disable-shared --prefix=<install directory> 
 make
 make check
 make install

We have tested MRAPI on the following platforms:
  *linux 2.4.21-40 running on a dual-core 64bit AMD opteron
  *WindowsXP on a dell latitude laptop using cygwin (gcc 3.4.4 cygming special)
  *linux 2.6.23 running on a dual-core 32bit Powerpc e500v2 (8572)
  *linux 2.6.9 running on a single-core 64bit AMD opteron


Notes for cross-compilation:
To cross-compile, pass the --build and --host options to autogen, powerpc example:
--build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=powerpc-e500mc-linux-gnu
This will look for executables like: powerpc-e500mc-linux-gnu-gcc so make sure they 
are in your path.

Notes for building baremetal:
To build for baremetal (no OS support), pass the --enable-baremetal option to autogen.

Notes for passing a simulator option (used for baremetal regression).  example:
./autogen.sh --enable-baremetal --with-adl=/proj/ppc/mana/v5/adliss_releases/20090119/bin/

Notes for cygwin:
cygserver provides the sysvr4 support that MRAPI needs for 
semaphores and shared memory.

1) when you install cygwin don't check the "install only for me" 
option because it prevents cygserver from working because it 
can't see all the mounts. 

2) run the following commands to start cygserver
export CYGWIN=server
net start cygserver


You may also be interested in the conker (concurrency kernel) suite of benchmarks.  
These tests compare the various types of MCAPI communication against pipes and 
sockets for both forked and pthreaded tests.  There is also a mcapi_demo.pl 
script in the conker/scripts directory that will pop-up a GUI for running the
benchmarks as well as graphs of the results.
