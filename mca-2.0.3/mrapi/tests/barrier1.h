  NOTE: The called needs to create a mutex for the barrier to use and

  NOTE: it's up to the caller to handle resetting the barrier if they want
   to use it multiple times.  The safest way to do this is to have two
   barriers.  This avoids the case where the first guy through zeroes the
   barrier before the others have a chance to notice.
